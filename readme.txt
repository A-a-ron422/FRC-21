INTAKE
same motor for intake - 1 motor for moving the rollers
2 pistons for up/down

TRANSVERSAL
two motors - belt on bottom, in between

CLIMBER
two motors - winchs

FLYWHEEL
two Spark Maxes

CELL STOP
one motor




SUBSYSTEM METHODS LEFT TO WRITE:
- Transversal

COMMANDS LEFT TO DO
- Warm up flywheel (turn on & only end command when the speed is high enough - see 2020 code)
- Toggle slow/fast
- Vomit (run flywheel + cell stop + transversal + intake backwards at start, stop them when the command ends)

- Shoot command group (warm up flywheel for like a second -> run cell stop -> run transversal)
- Stop shooting command group (stop transversal -> stop cell stop -> stop flywheel)
    

commands are command base, command groups are command group base





intake up and down sounds like an easy command to work on
